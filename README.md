And the [main Julia/Turing pPCA tutorial](https://turing.ml/v0.21/tutorials/11-probabilistic-pca).

What is here are only minor changes and adaptation for my own needs ([species composition in marine environments and feeding networks](https://github.com/jae0/aegis)).

## Conditional AutoRegressive ("CAR") models 

CAR models are just about the simplest possible way of accounting for spatial autorcorrelation. It is essentially the analogue of the temporal ARIMA type models but in space. It is arguably even simpler as the units of space are discrete areal units (arbitrary polygons). Originally it was formulated in lattice form from the Ising models in physics. Its use is most prevalent in epidemiology made accessible by the original Besag-York-Mollie paper, Leroux and Riebler, and many others.

For the R implementation (front-end to INLA): see https://github.com/jae0/carstm .

## Conditional AutoRegressive Space-Time Models (in Julia) and other approaches: 

- CAR/ICAR/BYM areal unit models (space)
- GP models in time or space or covariates ("features")
- Temporal (dynamical) models  
- Spacetime models that combine all of the above using Julia/Turing

Most didactic are the examples that use STAN (see info copied from various sources in "docs/example_car_stan.md"). 

The INLA/R, BRMS/R, Turing/Julia (subdirectory examples) implementations are confirming parameter estimates.

Ultimately, we use Julia/Turing due to simplicity and speed and attempt to develop a useful statistical and dynamical model of snow crab spatiotemporal processes.

It is similar in scope to the github.com/jae0/carstm, however, with no reliance upon INLA for computation.
